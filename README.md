# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
Using Ruby 2.6.0
      Rails 5.2.2
      Sqlite3 1.3.6
      bootstrap 4.3.1



* Deployment instructions
    Clone repository
    Run bundle install
    Run rails db:migrate
    Run bin/rails server

This project is pretty much bare bones unfortunately but it is a functioning To-Do List that allows you to create, read, update and delete items.  The web page is responsive as well. The CSS stylings were done with bootstrap.  
Hopefully this covers the items required.
